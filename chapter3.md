#CHAPTER 3 SPECIAL LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES

## Section I. INTRODUCTION

### GENERAL
It is by no means true that every situation whichthe commander encounters requires a special leadership technique. The techniques listed in chapter2 have an inherent elasticity and flexibility andare adaptable to any situation. Special supplementary leadership techniques are required, however, to meet certain problems such as duty in thecombat zone or communications zone, mobilizationtraining, demobilization, occupation duty, andleading minority groups. This chapter presentscertain techniques useful in the solution of thesespecial problems.

## Section II. COMBAT ZONE

### ADDITIONAL LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES FOR COMBAT

1. Training in leadership is essential to successin combat. Battle conditions demand decisionsand operations which test the leadership of all officers and all noncommissioned officers, of allgrades, to an extent which does not exist underother conditions. It is impossible to bridge completely the gap between training and conditionsexisting on the battlefield. Therefore, in combatthere are certain additional techniques which mustbe applied to meet these special conditions.
1. The problem of the leader is to attain the objective with the maximum of effectiveness and economy. To attain this objective
  1. Develop fully the combat power of all elements of your command.
  1. Coordinate and control combat power so  as to gain maximum effectiveness in destroying the enemy.
  1. Restore promptly any part of the potential combat power which may have been reduced or destroyed.
  1. Recognize battlefield conditions which  might damage the combat potential of your command.
1. Combat power is developed by creating andsustaining a desire to close with and destroy theenemy. In large measure, it is gained by experttraining, by the fostering of confidence, and by aknowledge of the fact that forward movementtends to reduce casualties. In developing aggressiveness, the leader will
  1. Strive to eliminate factors which produceinertia, timidity, or uncertainty.
  1. Stimulate in all echelons implicit confidence in weapons and leaders.
1. Encourage all leaders to exercise initiative and to exploit favorable situations.
  1. Condemn all forms of complacency, however temporary, that may arise from a  false feeling of security.
  1. Indoctrinate his command with the necessity for maintaining the momentum  of the attack.
  1. Reward evidence of aggressiveness by
  every means feasible, including decorations and unit awards.
1. Firepower produces combat power. Lack of
firepower is uneconomical, in that such lack must
be compensated for by commitment of disproportionate forces. Combat training must lay emphasis upon economy and effectiveness of fire. To develop firepower, the leader will
  1. Stress control and coordination of thefire of all weapons and emphasize firedistribution.
  1. Emphasize the necessity of firepoweragainst areas or positions without specific target designation or identification.
  1. Emphasize the necessity to economize onammunition, along with the need foreffectiveness of fire. Guard against thetendency toward "trigger happiness"which is manifested by inexperienced troops.

1. To gain maximum effectiveness in destroying
the enemy, coordination and control of combat
power is essential at all times. To maintain
momentum of attack, operation plans must be
supervised to their execution. The commander
must be accurately informed of the location of all
elements, particularly of the forward elements, of
his command. The leader will
  1. Issue orders in time for subordinates to
  coordinate their own plans.
  1. Insure the establishment and full use of
  adequate signal communication.
  1. Encourage direct coordination between
  commanders of attacking echelons.
  1. Make full use of phase lines, forward
  and rear echelons of control, and other
  coordination agencies.
  1. See that communication and liaison with
  higher, lower, and adjacent units are established. Make sure that command channels of specially organized forces are
  adequately and clearly defined.
  1. Insofar as practical, personally observe
  the progress of the battle and the efficiency of control. The commander who remains in his command post is courting
  disaster.

1. Attainment of objectives is dependent upon
restoration of the potential combat power of any
part of the command which has been weakened or
destroyed by enemy action. With the rapidity of
movement in modern warfare, it is imperative that
men and equipment be replaced rapidly. This entails efficient movement, proper reserve and support positions, and assignment of units to missions
within their capabilities. To maintain potential
combat power, the leader must
  1. Insure that the chain of command remains intact. Make necessary replacements of subordinates promptly.
  1. Permit adequate time in reserve position
  for units to assimilate replacements, to
  reorganize and regroup, to train, and to
  replace and maintain equipment.
  1. Devote special attention to units which
  have failed in combat, to restore their
  confidence and esprit de corps.
  1. See that subsequent missions of such
  units are within their capabilities.
  1. When advisable, make prompt replacement of commanders. Wholesale replacements, however, may serve to accentuate
  failure to the unit and thus lower esprit
  de corps.
1. Factors adversely affecting the combat potential of the command include fear; panic; discouragement; isolation; and lack of confidence in self, unit, or leaders. The presence of fear and
panic fluctuates in accordance with the condition
of troops, the degree of tactical success, and the
physical conditions of the battlefield. The greatest
susceptibility to fear and panic usually exists during baptism of fire, retrograde movement, or when
the unit is dispersed or isolated. Normally, it is
the commander of the small unit who must counteract such elements. However, it is the leader of
the large unit who trains and indoctrinates him
and who enunciates policies which should be instrumental in counteracting possible fear or panic.To counteract these factors, the leader should
  1. Insure that his troops are fed and rested
  whenever possible, since hunger or exhaustion leads to lowered morale and reduces combat efficiency.
  1. Combat the effect of false rumor by
  building up a reputation for truthfulness
  and frankness.
  1. Minimize or eliminate, when possible,
  those physical and combat conditions
  which might produce fear or panic.
  1. Inculcate in his command those factors
  which oppose such psychological conditions as anxiety, tension, insecurity, and
  uncertainty, by keeping his men informed and by promoting group identification.
  1. Furnish every possible support, physical
  and moral, for units which are isolated.
  Do not allow such units to feel that they
  are neglected, abandoned, or fighting a
  sacrifice mission.
  1. Emphasize indoctrination which will
  prepare the unit to wage aggressive combat in the fact of reverses, of isolation,
  and of the unexpected.

## LEADERSHIP FOR ATTACHED UNITS

1. One of the major leadership problems that
confronts the commanders of larger combat units
such as divisions, corps, and armies is the proper
handling of attached units. In corps especially,
there is a continuous turn-over of divisions and
separate units during the course of a campaign.
The corps commander has the difficult problem of
integrating newly attached units into the corps
effort and of giving them a sense of belonging to
the team. This calls for certain leadership techniques of a special nature in addition to the more
general techniques previously discussed.
  1. To integrate newly attached units into his
  command, the commander should1. Establish communication with a newly
  attached unit at the earliest practicable
  time.
  1. Insure that liaison is established with a
  unit as soon as he learns it is to be attached.
  1. Deliver promptly a brief of all current
  standing operating procedures and administrative policies to the commander
  and staff of a newly attached unit.
  1. Make all necessary administrative arrangements for the efficient reception of
  a unit newly attached to his command.
  1. Insure that administrative responsibility
  for attached units is clearly defined and
  promptly accepted.
  1. Prevent unnecessary administrative reporting to his headquarters by attached
  units.
  1. Require his staff to observe the chain of
  command in dealing with attached units.
1. Visit attached units, even though they
  may be further attached to subordinate
  units.
  1. Require his staff to visit newly attached
  units to ascertain what assistance his
  command can render.
  1. Be familiar with the history of every
  unit attached to his command.
  1. Insist that subordinate commanders include attached units in recommendations
  for decorations and awards.
  1. Encourage commanders of attached
  units to make their problems or suggestions known to him.
  1. Check plans of subordinate commanders
  to see that attached units are not discriminated against in missions assigned.
  1. See that attached units receive their fair
  share of all privileges and welfare activities. Make these units feel that they are
  an integral part of his team.
  1. Write a letter of appreciation to a departing unit whenever its service merits
  such action.

### SIGNAL COMMUNICATION

1. Just as leadership and command are inseparable, so, in turn, are command and signal communication inseparable. Thus it follows that
leadership and communication are in equally close
association; it is therefore essential that the leader
use all available signal communication facilities In
the application of the techniques of leadership.
1. The establishment and operation of signal
communications in the communications zone is not
difficult, since methods follow peacetime commercial practices. Technological improvements in signal communication facilities, however, introduce two important factors into the problem of leadership in battle:
  1. The ability of the commander to exercise
  leadership and tactical control is being
  constantly extended.
  1. Senior officers who are not in frequent
  contact with modern signal equipment
  experience difficulty in becoming, or in
  remaining, adept in its use.
1. To know his job, it is essential that a commander become thoroughly acquainted with the
capabilities and limitations of the signal communication equipment which is furnished. For higher
commanders it is not necessary to know the details
of its functioning, but only what it can accomplish.
However, any commander, who may be even temporarily required to use voice radio personally
should become familiar with the operation of the
equipment.
1. With the continued development of modern
signal communication facilities, the commander of
higher units are afforded increasing opportunity
to comprehend quickly the conditions faced by
their troops. Consequently, it enables the commander to exert his leadership ability to a degree
hitherto unknown. By creating a staff-observer
radio net, it is possible to emphasize most principles of leadership, though the chief application
must be that of tactical control.
1. The use of staff observers to assist the leader
has long been established practice. The practice is
greatly facilitated by the designation of a special
radio frequency for staff use. The commander and
the staff officer thus are enabled to become personally mobile, to have the advantage of on-the spot observation, and to keep in touch with the situation, with one another, and with staff sections
at the command post. Staff observers equipped
with vehicular-mounted radios may travel with
the headquarters of subordinate commands whose
action may be critical. They operate in the same
net as the commander and staff and report the
position of the units accompanied and the salient
facts of the situation. Staff observers are not investigators. Their primary function is to help the
command to which they are attached or are
accompanying.

## Section III. COMMUNICATIONS ZONE

### GENERAL

While service in the communications zone usually entails less hardship and danger than is encountered in the combat zone, close attention to
leadership principles and techniques is still necessary. The troops lack the incentive of combat
service. The commander does not have the advantage of unit identification with its attendant
history and background. The emphasis that has
been placed upon service with combat units has
often reacted to the detriment of the morale of
service troops. Yet the opening of ports, the delivery of supplies, and similar activities in record
time can be employed to generate pride and develop esprit de corps.

### TECHNIQUES

There are additional techniques applicable to
leadership of larger units in the communications
zone. The commander of these units should
1. Utilize his staff, particularly the special staff,
to familiarize him with the various types of service
units under his command.
1. Delegate authority to his staff, especially to
the chiefs of technical services, for supervision of
units and accomplishment of assigned tasks. Remember, however, that final responsibility always
rests with the highest commander.
1. Determine the requirements and obtain a
balanced troop list that is adequate for the task.
1. Plan so that logistical support will be available when needed.
1. Maintain the highest possible standard of
living consistent with avoidance of justified criticism by combat zone personnel. However, he
should avoid requiring service troops to be uncomfortable merely because discomfort is unavoidable
in the combat zone.
1. Prevent the diversion of personnel and means
intended for the combat zone.
1. Prescribe a uniform for his troops appropriate to the work performed. Service troops should
not be required to dress as combat troops unless a
real need exists.
1. Make special arrangements for combat troops
who are temporarily stationed in the communications zone. Conferences between commanders
should develop an interpretation of regulations
which does not cause resentment by either combat
or service troops.
1. Identify each project with the combat effort
of the theater of operations. Stress the part each
particular unit has in support of major operations.
Devise ways by which the command will know
what it has accomplished and how it can do better.
1. Subject to security restrictions, maintain
situation maps in each unit to keep troops informed of the progress of operations.
1. Assure himself that the administrative requirements of supported commands are promptly
and adequately met. Maintain liaison with supported commands.
1. When troops must be worked for excessively
long hours on a particular job, insure that they
understand their contribution to the over-all effort.
1. Employ units in the role for which they were
organized and trained except in emergency. Be
prepared to select and train physically able troops
for combat duty in case of emergency.
1. Maintain a high standard of discipline and
service efficiency. Take advantage of ceremonies
to engender unit esprit de corps, but avoid encroaching on essential duties or recreational time.
1. Where personnel stability permits, provide
educational facilities for those desiring to participate on a voluntary basis.

## Section IV. LEADERSHIP IN MOBILIZATION TRAINING

### GENERAL
a. The material which follows is primarily related to training. It is included in this text because
it directly affects the study and development of
leadership in all units.
b. The commander charged with the training
of newly activated units must consider not only the
leadership which he himself exerts, but also that
of his subordinate commanders as well. The efficacy of his leadership will be reflected in the sum
total of their command abilities. It is of paramount importance that he develop leadership qualities in his subordinates: first, those manifested by
traits of character; and second, those based on
confidence which arises from knowing the job and
which are demonstrated by the ability to maneuver
and control troops in a coordinated effort.
c. One of the most important leadership responsibilities of the commander both before and during
mobilization training is the establishment of harmonious relations with the members of the adja48

AGO 3167C

cent civilian communities. The commander must
stimulate public support and cooperation by personal appearances before civic groups and personal yisits to important civic officials such as the
mayor and chief of police. During such visits, the
commander and members of his staff must explain
the mission of the units undergoing mobilization
training and point out various problems that are
likely to arise when a large military organization
is suddenly superimposed upon a civilian community. Through mutual understanding between
the civilian and the military of each other's problems, undesirable incidents involving misunderstanding or animosity between soldier and civilian
will be held to a minimum. Moreover, the civilian
will not only accept but also welcome the soldier
and thus make a substantial contribution to the
soldier morale and esprit de corps.
d. Still another important leadership responsibility of the commander during mobilization training is the proper indoctrination of the cadre during their training prior- to the arrival of fillers.
The commander must impress upon all members
of the cadre that they will be the backbone of the
unit that is being formed around them; that they
must establish and maintain the highest standards
of discipline, training, and military courtesy so
that they, in turn, can suitably train and set the
example for the fillers. The commander who effectively applies the principles of leadership during
the cadre training period produces a cadre that is
efficient and well disciplined-a cadre that will be
the nucleus for an efficient and well-disciplined
AGO 3167C

49

organization. The unfit must be eliminated from
the cadre.
24. COMBAT LEADERSHIP TRAINING

a. In training a new unit, the commander will
recognize that ability to lead troops in combat is
the prime requirement of junior leaders. Moreover, facility in handling troops is a technique and
as such is far easier for a commander to develop
in his subordinates than is leadership of the inspirational type. Men do not learn to lead troops
from theoretical instruction alone. They learn
mainly by experience in command. Therefore, the
commander must insure that the opportunity to
command exists. For example, he must insist that
all echelons of command follow strictly the provisions of the mobilization training programs which,
for most divisional units, require that nearly 50
percent of training time be spent in unit field
exercises.
b. In this phase, "know your job" is a basic
element in instruction of new units. Realistic adherence to high standards of duty in all training is
the fundamental.
c. Techniques available to the leaders of all
units by which their own leadership training, and
that of their subordinates, can be greatly facilitated are1. Map exercises and maneuver.
1. Command post exercises.
1. Field exercises.
50

AGO 31i7C

d. Instructions for the conduct of these exercises are found in appropriate manuals. Correct
training methods and logical training progression,
however, are of such importance in the development of battle leadership that some elaboration of
these subjects is considered desirable and will be
covered in succeeding paragraphs.
e. Whenever possible, combination of the three
types of exercises laid on the same terrain is useful
for training in leadership as well as in the tactical
handling of troops. Initially, the exercise may be
conducted on a map, then be repeated on the
ground as a command post exercise. Finally, when
the training of the troops has progressed sufficiently, the same situation may be portrayed as a
field exercise. Thus, through logical progression
the commanders learn the theoretical aspects of
leadership in the map exercise, map maneuver,
and command post exercise, and then apply this
theory to the field exercise, employing actual
troops.
25. MAP EXERCISES AND MAP MANEUVERS

a. General. The definitions and conduct of map
exercises and map maneuvers are found in FM
21-5. These are devices for training commanders
and staff officers in the theoretical conduct of military operations by means of a map. Map exercises
and map maneuvers are not substitutes for command post exercises and field exercises.
b. Techniques.
1. Whenever possible, base the exercise or
AGO 3167C

51

maneuver on local terrain so that the
same tactical situation can later be
played in the field by subordinate headquarters and subordinate units.
1. Prepare the map maneuver so that all
sections of the staff will participate.
1. Stress realism by introducing requirements for staff supervision of the action
portrayed and approved techniques for
carrying it out.
26. COMMAND POST EXERCISES

a. General. A command post exercise can be
one of the most important leadership-training devices, depending on the manner in which it is executed. Where many artificialities are employed,
where the senior commander faces a situation requiring no leadership or command decisions on his
part, or where the exercise fails to develop logically, very little value is realized. It is possible to
avoid such adverse factors through the application
of realism, to include a freely developing situation
which demands a series of command decisions on
the part of all echelons. A command post exercise
fills its primary purpose only when it affords
leadership training for all commanders and their
staffs.
b. Techniques.
1. Require command post exercises in all
echelons, down to and including battalions. Schedule these to precede the
field exercises for small units which are
52

AGO 2167C

required by the mobilization training
program. These two exercises should be
based on the same situation.
1. Wherever possible, hold command post
exercises on the ground. Require' all
headquarters elements to be deployed at
appropriate distances and to move in accordance with the developments of the
situation.
1. In all command post exercises, require
units to pass information back to the
next higher echelon, using organic means
of communication.
1. Require all echelons to act on the factual
or imaginary information furnished by
executing their original plan of action,
revising it, or calling for additional
means.
1. Adopt an attitude that the exercise is for
the training of all, including the commander. Stress the fact that neither the
commander nor any other leader can develop command. facility without practice,
and that the command post exercise gives
experience in correcting mistakes without causing the troops to suffer for them.
1. Schedule command post exercises in any
one echelon'only after the next lower
echelon has become proficient in passing
on the battle reports which actuate the
situation for its commander.
AGO 3167C

53

1. Use the chain of command in making
necessary corrections in the progress of
the exercise.
1. Realize that, while a command post exercise may be held for a commander and
his headquarters with only the next
lower echelon present, the exercise will
always benefit by the presence of as many
headquarters as can be spared at that
stage of training.
1. Insist that staffs be used in a realistic
manner to plan and supervise all phases
of the exercise.
27. FIELD EXERCISES

a. General. Field exercises, particularly those
for small units, provide the best training test of
combat leadership ability and the best training
experience in developing it. Next to battle itself,
they are the end toward which all training is
directed. Failure to stress this type of training
results in low standards of leadership being
brought to the battlefield. The techniques of conducting field exercises are covered in appropriate
training manuals. However, because of their direct relation to leadership training, the following
techniques are given special emphasis.
b. Techniques.
1. Stress realism. The modern battlefield
under conditions of mobile warfare appears empty. Since the battlefield does
appear empty, normally plan exercises
54

AGO 3167C

which involve an advance to seize terrain
objectives.
1. Require repeated drills in the execution
of simple tactical maneuvers designed to
capture the planned objectives.
1. Stress logical progression of training.
Precede field exercises with instruction
in evaluation of terrain, with combat
orders, and with command post exercises
drawn for the same terrain and situation.
1. State the conditions of enemy fire which
are supposed to exist over the ground
traversed, or specific parts thereof. Do
not introduce complicated artificialities;
these only detract from the commander's
ability to concentrate on the control of
his unit and on the selection of a formation appropriate to the conditions of fire.
The end in view is leadership ability as
exemplified by facility in handling the
unit.
1. Stress the importance of each leader so
placing himself and his headquarters
that he can most readily coordinate all
efforts of his command and of the elements that may be supporting it.
1. Do not permit exercises against flagged
enemy positions, or two-sided maneuvers,
until leadership facility in command and
control has been demonstrated.
AGO 3167C

55

1. Wherever possible, employ current methods for marking support fires. Require
that such marking, with accompanying
movement, simulate battle conditions, if
feasible.
1. Stress the importance of exchange of
information by all appropriate means.
1. Have a well-planned critique immediately after each field exercise.

## Section V. LEADERSHIP IN DEMOBILIZATION
28. DEMOBILIZATION

After each war, the Army is confronted with
the difficult problem of demobilization. Divergent
and often conflicting objectives usually face the
Army at such a time. Some of these area. To return personnel to civilian life quickly.
h. To demobilize personnel in a just and fair
order.
c. To retain and maintain highly efficient forces
for occupation duties and for other commitments
of armed security at home and abroad.
d. To care for billions of dollars worth of supplies and equipment, and to assist in the disposal
of surplus.
e. To maintain morale in the Armed Forces and
civilian population.
f. To continue the induction or enlistment of
personnel as required.
56

AGO 3167C

g. To secure public acceptance of the demobilization plan.
29. TECHNIQUES
Leadership techniques that particularly apply
to demobilization area. Early Planning in all Elements of the Command.
1. The essence of a demobilization plan, regardless of the size of the military unit
involved, is that it is fair and just to the
individual, does not leave a weak, ineffective defense force, and can be carried out
expeditiously with the means available.
Mass demobilization procedures which
overtax facilities, both in the theater and
in the continental United States, and
which strip fighting and service units of
essential personnel are not justified solely
because of personal desires. These desires, expressed individually or in mass,
exert strong pressure for the rapid release of personnel from service without
regard to military expediency.
1. Early planning in division and higher
commands is dependent upon directives
received from higher authority. It is
here that new leaders must be trained to
take over the responsibilities of experienced demobilized veterans. All troops
must be carefully oriented on the why
and how of the demobilization plan.
AGO 3167C

57

b. Educationof Both Army Personneland Civilians. One of the most important objectives of a
demobilization program is public acceptance. Although all Army personnel must know and understand the plan, basic support must come from the
civilian population. This support can be gained
only by providing a sound, fair plan which is made
known through a carefully conceived, forcefully
executed public information program. Initial impetus is gained through indoctrinating officers
and men who will, in turn, inform friends and
relatives. Continuous emphasis must be placed on
the responsibilities of the Armed Forces for furthering national interest. The press and the public must be solidly behind procedures of the demobilization plan.
c. Fairness to the Individual. A war of any appreciable duration will find practically all units
containing personnel with wide differences in age,
service, and family responsibility. If, at the end
of any future war, demobilization is based on individual criteria, those parts of the plan dealing
with the interests of individuals must be planned
and executed fairly.
d. Maintenance of Morale and Esprit de corps.
Any method of demobilization based entirely on
individual criteria will ultimately destroy group
identity. This is true not only of units that are
selected to remain in being, but also of units that
are used as vehicles for returning individuals
for demobilization. Large groups of personnel will
suddenly find themselves among strangers, in
strange surroundings, and under strange leaders.
58

AGO 3167C

Some methods that may prove useful in such units
for builaing and maintaining morale and esprit de
corps are1. To keep troops busy on useful work.
1. To separate as quickly as possible personnel to be demobilized from those who
are to remain in the service.
1. To make every effort to insure that demobilization plans work smoothly.
1. To make men leaving the Army feel that
their service has been appreciated and
that every effort has been made to separate them from the service in an efficient
manner.
1. To indoctrinate remaining men with the
importance of their work and service.
30. ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR UNITS COMPOSED
OF PERSONNEL TO BE DEMOBILIZED

a. Welcome veterans to the unit. Foster a
"sense of belonging" among those assigned from
other units.
b. Orient and inform personnel. Officers and
men must be kept informed of the status of demobilization as it affects them and of any reasons
for delays which may develop.
c. Include preparation for return to civilian life
in training. Courses of study in civilian pursuits
should be made available. Training should promote the health of the individual, and discipline
and pride in his unit.
AGO 3167C

59

d. Provide good food, billets, living conditions,
and recreation.
e. Stress discipline, appearance, saluting, uniform, and unit athletics. Encourage men to wear
service ribbons, decorations, and any other authorized symbols of previous service. Where practicable, arrange for officers and men from the same
combat unit to remain together until separation
from the service.
f. Avoid rash promises and commitments.
Keep in mind that the best of plans go astray for
unforeseen reasons.
g. Avoid changes and counterorders. By thorough planning, seek stability for the unit and for
its individuals. Keep changes in orders and shifts
of personnel to a minimum.

## Section VI.

LEADERSHIP OF OCCUPATION FORCES

31. OCCUPATION MISSIONS
Primary missions of occupation forces are to
support the military government of the occupied
territory and to protect that territory from external aggression and from internal uprising.
Secondary missions may include supervising and
regulating certain activities of the inhabitants of
the occupied territory; supervising and directing
essential rehabilitation and reconstruction; supplying necessities to the population; controlling
borders; supporting civil police; and conducting
training not only to fit the forces for carrying out
60

AGO 3167C

their occupation missions, but also to maintain
them as capable combat forces.
32. SPECIAL FACTORS
Some factors peculiar to occupation
which bear on leadership are-

duties

a. Foreign Duty. A large proportion of the
troops may not be serving overseas from choice.
The foreign population may naturally resent the
presence of an occupying force and may oppose it
by various means.
b. Incentive. Generally, it is difficult to convert
troops from their combat missions to those of occupation. The commander must expect a natural
let-down of interest on the part of the occupation
troops if no new incentives are provided and accepted by them.
c. Availability of Forces. The early stages of
the occupation are likely to be characterized by an
abundance of troops for occupation tasks. Later a
shortage may exist. Furthermore, a rapid turnover of personnel of the occupation forces may result from short-term enlistments, time required
for training replacements in the continental
United States, shipping time from the continental
United States, demobilization criteria, and other
factors beyond the control of the occupation force
commanders. These factors will increase the
training problems of the occupation forces, particularly with respect to junior officers and noncommissioned officers.
AGO 3167C

61

d. Maintenance of High Standards of Discipline. Not only is it necessary to carry out the
normal administrative duties of occupation efficiently, but also it is essential to gain and maintain
the respect of the conquered populace. A highly
disciplined force will have little trouble controlling
those who respect its military efficiency.
33. TECHNIQUES TO BE EMPHASIZED

All leadership techniques discussed previously
apply equally well to the commander of occupation
forces. Some additional techniques area. To keep occupation forces informed of the
purpose and importance of their mission.
b. To do everything possible to make the tour of
occupation duty interesting for the command. Provide recreation facilities, tours within the occupied
and adjacent countries, comfortable billets, good
food, and freedom from menial tasks that can be
performed by the conquered population. Provide
instruction for the troops in the language of the
occupied country.
c. To treat the civil population fairly, firmly,
and courteously. Proper relations will greatly assist in breaking down the people's natural resentment towards occupation forces.
d. To keep troops busy on essential work and
training, or at interesting and wholesome recreation.
e. To provide the best in uniforms, arms, and
equipment, and insist upon outstanding appearance.
62

AGO 3167C

f. To select leaders carefully. Popularity alone
within the unit is one of the poorest criterions in
these selections.
g. To demonstrate to your command that you
are part of it. The failures of the men are your
failures, and their successes are likewise yours.

## Section VII.

LEADERSHIP OF MINORITY GROUPS

34. MINORITY GROUPS

Within our nation there are many groups which
are considered minority groups-racial, religious,
and cultural. Since the Army's concern is only the
employment of men on their individual merit so
that they may contribute most efficiently and effectively to the national effort, it follows that the
Army's interest in any minority group extends
only to distinctive differences which may necessitate special handling. These differences lie in such
factors as general ability, physical strength, diet
needs, mechanical skills, language, and education.
The problem of using certain minority groups with
greater efficiency has caused grave concern during
the past two wars. In a future war, this problem
may be of greater magnitude. For this considerable portion of our National manpower resources,
the Army must accept the responsibility for providing competent leadership. At the same time,
leaders must avoid any effort to foster social experiments within the structure of the Military
Establishment except when expressly ordered by
higher authority to do so. The principles in chapAGO 3167C

ter 1 apply to the leading of any minority group in
the United States. The greatest sources of difficulty lie in the lack of thorough understanding of
the characteristics of the group, and in the failure
to recognize the fact that individual differences
are greater and more significant than are group
differences.
35. TECHNIQUES

A need for outstanding leadership is imperative
in units composed of personnel from recognized
minority groups. This need cannot be met by increased quantity of leaders alone; the quality of
leadership must be of the highest order. The following techniques are presented for the purpose
of amplifying the basic principles of leadership
and of applying them to minority group units:
a. Recognize that all soldiers are entitled to
identical treatment and to fundamental rights,
privileges, and opportunities regardless of differences in race, color, creed, or cultural background.
To accept less for your unit invites unfavorable
criticism; to demand more creates an undesirable
reaction from all elements.
b. Set the example in tolerance, understanding,
and freedom from prejudice. Become worthy of
being emulated as a broad-minded, unprejudiced
leader.
c. Avoid creating the impression of either hostility or patronizing condescension.
d. Develop an understanding of minority group
problems and feelings by observation and study.

It is only by first-hand knowledge that any race or
group may be understood. Diligent study of group
problems tends to destroy false beliefs and conceptions.
e. Develop in your men initiative and a sense of
responsibility by providing means and opportunities for fostering and improving these traits.
f. Impress your unit with the fact that the
Army is concerned primarily with the development
of soldiers and leaders and that each man will be
afforded opportunity to develop his own capabilities and capacities.
g. Be sure that adequate provisions are made
for off-duty time. When civilian facilities are
limited or restricted, increase the military recreational program accordingly.
h. Be patient in training progress. It is better
to build slowly toward high standards than to
neglect details.
i. Maintain the same standards as are required
of comparable units.

## Section VIII. LEADERSHIP OF FEMALE GROUPS

36. FEMALE GROUPS

While WAC's, nurses, and female civilian employees, Red Cross workers, and USO entertainersdo not constitute a minority group, their presencewith the Army poses certain problems of leader ship. Individually, or as a group, women requirecertain facilities and items not essential to malepersonnel; among these are-special facilities forbilleting, transportation, hospitalization, and recreation, and special items of individual equipmentand supply. The particulars concerning leadership of women are contained in appropriate publications prepared by the Women's Army Corps.
