#CHAPTER 3 SPECIAL LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES

## Section I. INTRODUCTION

### GENERAL
It is by no means true that every situation which the commander encounters requires a special leadership technique. The techniques listed in chapter2 have an inherent elasticity and flexibility and are adaptable to any situation. Special supplementary leadership techniques are required, however, to meet certain problems such as duty in the combat zone or communications zone, mobilization training, demobilization, occupation duty, andleading minority groups. This chapter presents certain techniques useful in the solution of thesespecial problems.

## Section II. COMBAT ZONE

### ADDITIONAL LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES FOR COMBAT

1. Training in leadership is essential to successin combat. Battle conditions demand decisionsand operations which test the leadership of all officers and all noncommissioned officers, of allgrades, to an extent which does not exist underother conditions. It is impossible to bridge completely the gap between training and conditionsexisting on the battlefield. Therefore, in combatthere are certain additional techniques which mustbe applied to meet these special conditions.
1. The problem of the leader is to attain the objective with the maximum of effectiveness and economy. To attain this objective
  1. Develop fully the combat power of all elements of your command.
  1. Coordinate and control combat power so  as to gain maximum effectiveness in destroying the enemy.
  1. Restore promptly any part of the potential combat power which may have been reduced or destroyed.
  1. Recognize battlefield conditions which  might damage the combat potential of your command.
1. Combat power is developed by creating andsustaining a desire to close with and destroy theenemy. In large measure, it is gained by experttraining, by the fostering of confidence, and by aknowledge of the fact that forward movementtends to reduce casualties. In developing aggressiveness, the leader will
  1. Strive to eliminate factors which produceinertia, timidity, or uncertainty.
  1. Stimulate in all echelons implicit confidence in weapons and leaders.
1. Encourage all leaders to exercise initiative and to exploit favorable situations.
  1. Condemn all forms of complacency, however temporary, that may arise from a  false feeling of security.
  1. Indoctrinate his command with the necessity for maintaining the momentum  of the attack.
  1. Reward evidence of aggressiveness by
  every means feasible, including decorations and unit awards.
1. Firepower produces combat power. Lack of
firepower is uneconomical, in that such lack must
be compensated for by commitment of disproportionate forces. Combat training must lay emphasis upon economy and effectiveness of fire. To develop firepower, the leader will
  1. Stress control and coordination of thefire of all weapons and emphasize firedistribution.
  1. Emphasize the necessity of firepoweragainst areas or positions without specific target designation or identification.
  1. Emphasize the necessity to economize onammunition, along with the need foreffectiveness of fire. Guard against thetendency toward "trigger happiness"which is manifested by inexperienced troops.
1. To gain maximum effectiveness in destroyingthe enemy, coordination and control of combatpower is essential at all times. To maintainmomentum of attack, operation plans must be supervised to their execution. The commandermust be accurately informed of the location of allelements, particularly of the forward elements, ofhis command. The leader will
  1. Issue orders in time for subordinates to coordinate their own plans.
  1. Insure the establishment and full use of adequate signal communication.
  1. Encourage direct coordination between commanders of attacking echelons.
  1. Make full use of phase lines, forward and rear echelons of control, and other coordination agencies.
  1. See that communication and liaison with higher, lower, and adjacent units are established. Make sure that command channels of specially organized forces are adequately and clearly defined.
  1. Insofar as practical, personally observe the progress of the battle and the efficiency of control. The commander who remains in his command post is courting disaster.
1. Attainment of objectives is dependent uponrestoration of the potential combat power of anypart of the command which has been weakened ordestroyed by enemy action. With the rapidity ofmovement in modern warfare, it is imperative thatmen and equipment be replaced rapidly. This entails efficient movement, proper reserve and support positions, and assignment of units to missionswithin their capabilities. To maintain potentialcombat power, the leader must  
  1. Insure that the chain of command remains intact. Make necessary replacements of subordinates promptly.
  1. Permit adequate time in reserve position for units to assimilate replacements, to reorganize and regroup, to train, and to replace and maintain equipment.  
  1. Devote special attention to units which have failed in combat, to restore their confidence and esprit de corps.
  1. See that subsequent missions of such units are within their capabilities.  1. When advisable, make prompt replacement of commanders. Wholesale replacements, however, may serve to accentuate failure to the unit and thus lower esprit de corps.
1. Factors adversely affecting the combat potential of the command include fear; panic; discouragement; isolation; and lack of confidence in self, unit, or leaders. The presence of fear andpanic fluctuates in accordance with the conditionof troops, the degree of tactical success, and thephysical conditions of the battlefield. The greatestsusceptibility to fear and panic usually exists during baptism of fire, retrograde movement, or whenthe unit is dispersed or isolated. Normally, it isthe commander of the small unit who must counteract such elements. However, it is the leader ofthe large unit who trains and indoctrinates himand who enunciates policies which should be instrumental in counteracting possible fear or panic. To counteract these factors, the leader should
  1. Insure that his troops are fed and rested whenever possible, since hunger or exhaustion leads to lowered morale and reduces combat efficiency.
  1. Combat the effect of false rumor by building up a reputation for truthfulness and frankness.
  1. Minimize or eliminate, when possible, those physical and combat conditions which might produce fear or panic.
  1. Inculcate in his command those factors which oppose such psychological conditions as anxiety, tension, insecurity, and uncertainty, by keeping his men informed and by promoting group identification.
  1. Furnish every possible support, physical and moral, for units which are isolated. Do not allow such units to feel that they are neglected, abandoned, or fighting a sacrifice mission.
  1. Emphasize indoctrination which will prepare the unit to wage aggressive combat in the fact of reverses, of isolation, and of the unexpected.

## LEADERSHIP FOR ATTACHED UNITS

1. One of the major leadership problems thatconfronts the commanders of larger combat unitssuch as divisions, corps, and armies is the properhandling of attached units. In corps especially, there is a continuous turn-over of divisions andseparate units during the course of a campaign.The corps commander has the difficult problem ofintegrating newly attached units into the corpseffort and of giving them a sense of belonging tothe team. This calls for certain leadership techniques of a special nature in addition to the moregeneral techniques previously discussed.
1. To integrate newly attached units into his command, the commander should
  1. Establish communication with a newly attached unit at the earliest practicable time.
  1. Insure that liaison is established with a unit as soon as he learns it is to be attached.
  1. Deliver promptly a brief of all current standing operating procedures and administrative policies to the commander and staff of a newly attached unit.
  1. Make all necessary administrative arrangements for the efficient reception of a unit newly attached to his command.
  1. Insure that administrative responsibility for attached units is clearly defined and promptly accepted.
  1. Prevent unnecessary administrative reporting to his headquarters by attached units.
  1. Require his staff to observe the chain of command in dealing with attached units.
  1. Visit attached units, even though they may be further attached to subordinate units.
  1. Require his staff to visit newly attached units to ascertain what assistance his command can render.
  1. Be familiar with the history of every unit attached to his command.
  1. Insist that subordinate commanders include attached units in recommendations for decorations and awards.
  1. Encourage commanders of attached units to make their problems or suggestions known to him.
  1. Check plans of subordinate commanders to see that attached units are not discriminated against in missions assigned.
  1. See that attached units receive their fair share of all privileges and welfare activities. Make these units feel that they are an integral part of his team.
  1. Write a letter of appreciation to a departing unit whenever its service merits such action.

### SIGNAL COMMUNICATION

1. Just as leadership and command are inseparable, so, in turn, are command and signal communication inseparable. Thus it follows thatleadership and communication are in equally closeassociation; it is therefore essential that the leader use all available signal communication facilities Inthe application of the techniques of leadership.
1. The establishment and operation of signalcommunications in the communications zone is notdifficult, since methods follow peacetime commercial practices. Technological improvements in signal communication facilities, however, introduce two important factors into the problem of leadership in battle:
  1. The ability of the commander to exercise leadership and tactical control is being constantly extended.
  1. Senior officers who are not in frequent contact with modern signal equipment experience difficulty in becoming, or in remaining, adept in its use.
1. To know his job, it is essential that a commander become thoroughly acquainted with thecapabilities and limitations of the signal communication equipment which is furnished. For highercommanders it is not necessary to know the detailsof its functioning, but only what it can accomplish.However, any commander, who may be even temporarily required to use voice radio personallyshould become familiar with the operation of theequipment.
1. With the continued development of modernsignal communication facilities, the commander ofhigher units are afforded increasing opportunityto comprehend quickly the conditions faced bytheir troops. Consequently, it enables the commander to exert his leadership ability to a degree hitherto unknown. By creating a staff-observerradio net, it is possible to emphasize most principles of leadership, though the chief applicationmust be that of tactical control.
1. The use of staff observers to assist the leaderhas long been established practice. The practice isgreatly facilitated by the designation of a specialradio frequency for staff use. The commander andthe staff officer thus are enabled to become personally mobile, to have the advantage of on-the spot observation, and to keep in touch with the situation, with one another, and with staff sectionsat the command post. Staff observers equippedwith vehicular-mounted radios may travel withthe headquarters of subordinate commands whoseaction may be critical. They operate in the samenet as the commander and staff and report theposition of the units accompanied and the salientfacts of the situation. Staff observers are not investigators. Their primary function is to help thecommand to which they are attached or areaccompanying.

## Section III. COMMUNICATIONS ZONE

### GENERAL

While service in the communications zone usually entails less hardship and danger than is encountered in the combat zone, close attention toleadership principles and techniques is still necessary. The troops lack the incentive of combatservice. The commander does not have the ad vantage of unit identification with its attendanthistory and background. The emphasis that hasbeen placed upon service with combat units hasoften reacted to the detriment of the morale ofservice troops. Yet the opening of ports, the delivery of supplies, and similar activities in recordtime can be employed to generate pride and develop esprit de corps.

### TECHNIQUES

There are additional techniques applicable toleadership of larger units in the communicationszone. The commander of these units should
  1. Utilize his staff, particularly the special staff,to familiarize him with the various types of serviceunits under his command.
  1. Delegate authority to his staff, especially tothe chiefs of technical services, for supervision ofunits and accomplishment of assigned tasks. Remember, however, that final responsibility alwaysrests with the highest commander.
  1. Determine the requirements and obtain abalanced troop list that is adequate for the task.
  1. Plan so that logistical support will be available when needed.
  1. Maintain the highest possible standard ofliving consistent with avoidance of justified criticism by combat zone personnel. However, heshould avoid requiring service troops to be uncomfortable merely because discomfort is unavoidablein the combat zone.
  1. Prevent the diversion of personnel and meansintended for the combat zone.
  1. Prescribe a uniform for his troops appropriate to the work performed. Service troops shouldnot be required to dress as combat troops unless areal need exists.
  1. Make special arrangements for combat troopswho are temporarily stationed in the communications zone. Conferences between commandersshould develop an interpretation of regulationswhich does not cause resentment by either combator service troops.
  1. Identify each project with the combat effortof the theater of operations. Stress the part eachparticular unit has in support of major operations.Devise ways by which the command will knowwhat it has accomplished and how it can do better.
  1. Subject to security restrictions, maintainsituation maps in each unit to keep troops informed of the progress of operations.
  1. Assure himself that the administrative requirements of supported commands are promptlyand adequately met. Maintain liaison with supported commands.
  1. When troops must be worked for excessivelylong hours on a particular job, insure that theyunderstand their contribution to the over-all effort.
  1. Employ units in the role for which they wereorganized and trained except in emergency. Beprepared to select and train physically able troopsfor combat duty in case of emergency.
  1. Maintain a high standard of discipline andservice efficiency. Take advantage of ceremonies
  to engender unit esprit de corps, but avoid encroaching on essential duties or recreational time.
  1. Where personnel stability permits, provideeducational facilities for those desiring to participate on a voluntary basis.

## Section IV. LEADERSHIP IN MOBILIZATION TRAINING

### GENERAL
1. The material which follows is primarily related to training. It is included in this text becauseit directly affects the study and development ofleadership in all units.
1. The commander charged with the trainingof newly activated units must consider not only theleadership which he himself exerts, but also thatof his subordinate commanders as well. The efficacy of his leadership will be reflected in the sumtotal of their command abilities. It is of paramount importance that he develop leadership qualities in his subordinates: first, those manifested bytraits of character; and second, those based onconfidence which arises from knowing the job andwhich are demonstrated by the ability to maneuverand control troops in a coordinated effort.
1. One of the most important leadership responsibilities of the commander both before and duringmobilization training is the establishment of harmonious relations with the members of the adja cent civilian communities. The commander muststimulate public support and cooperation by personal appearances before civic groups and personal yisits to important civic officials such as themayor and chief of police. During such visits, thecommander and members of his staff must explainthe mission of the units undergoing mobilizationtraining and point out various problems that arelikely to arise when a large military organizationis suddenly superimposed upon a civilian community. Through mutual understanding betweenthe civilian and the military of each other's problems, undesirable incidents involving misunderstanding or animosity between soldier and civilianwill be held to a minimum. Moreover, the civilianwill not only accept but also welcome the soldierand thus make a substantial contribution to thesoldier morale and esprit de corps.
1. Still another important leadership responsibility of the commander during mobilization training is the proper indoctrination of the cadre during their training prior- to the arrival of fillers.The commander must impress upon all membersof the cadre that they will be the backbone of theunit that is being formed around them; that theymust establish and maintain the highest standardsof discipline, training, and military courtesy sothat they, in turn, can suitably train and set theexample for the fillers. The commander who effectively applies the principles of leadership duringthe cadre training period produces a cadre that isefficient and well disciplined-a cadre that will bethe nucleus for an efficient and well-disciplined organization. The unfit must be eliminated fromthe cadre.

###. COMBAT LEADERSHIP TRAINING

1. In training a new unit, the commander willrecognize that ability to lead troops in combat isthe prime requirement of junior leaders. Moreover, facility in handling troops is a technique andas such is far easier for a commander to developin his subordinates than is leadership of the inspirational type. Men do not learn to lead troopsfrom theoretical instruction alone. They learnmainly by experience in command. Therefore, thecommander must insure that the opportunity tocommand exists. For example, he must insist thatall echelons of command follow strictly the provisions of the mobilization training programs which,for most divisional units, require that nearly 50percent of training time be spent in unit fieldexercises.
1. In this phase, "know your job" is a basicelement in instruction of new units. Realistic adherence to high standards of duty in all training isthe fundamental.
1. Techniques available to the leaders of allunits by which their own leadership training, andthat of their subordinates, can be greatly facilitated are
  1. Map exercises and maneuver.
  1. Command post exercises.
  1. Field exercises.
1. Instructions for the conduct of these exercises are found in appropriate manuals. Correcttraining methods and logical training progression,however, are of such importance in the development of battle leadership that some elaboration ofthese subjects is considered desirable and will becovered in succeeding paragraphs.
1. Whenever possible, combination of the threetypes of exercises laid on the same terrain is usefulfor training in leadership as well as in the tacticalhandling of troops. Initially, the exercise may beconducted on a map, then be repeated on theground as a command post exercise. Finally, whenthe training of the troops has progressed sufficiently, the same situation may be portrayed as afield exercise. Thus, through logical progressionthe commanders learn the theoretical aspects ofleadership in the map exercise, map maneuver,and command post exercise, and then apply thistheory to the field exercise, employing actualtroops.

### MAP EXERCISES AND MAP MANEUVERS

1. General. The definitions and conduct of mapexercises and map maneuvers are found in FM21-5. These are devices for training commandersand staff officers in the theoretical conduct of military operations by means of a map. Map exercisesand map maneuvers are not substitutes for command post exercises and field exercises.
1. Techniques.
  1. Whenever possible, base the exercise or maneuver on local terrain so that thesame tactical situation can later beplayed in the field by subordinate headquarters and subordinate units.
  1. Prepare the map maneuver so that allsections of the staff will participate.
  1. Stress realism by introducing requirements for staff supervision of the actionportrayed and approved techniques forcarrying it out.

### COMMAND POST EXERCISES

1. General. A command post exercise can beone of the most important leadership-training devices, depending on the manner in which it is executed. Where many artificialities are employed,where the senior commander faces a situation requiring no leadership or command decisions on hispart, or where the exercise fails to develop logically, very little value is realized. It is possible toavoid such adverse factors through the applicationof realism, to include a freely developing situationwhich demands a series of command decisions onthe part of all echelons. A command post exercisefills its primary purpose only when it affordsleadership training for all commanders and theirstaffs.
1. Techniques.
  1. Require command post exercises in allechelons, down to and including battalions. Schedule these to precede thefield exercises for small units which are required by the mobilization trainingprogram. These two exercises should bebased on the same situation.
  1. Wherever possible, hold command postexercises on the ground. Require' allheadquarters elements to be deployed atappropriate distances and to move in accordance with the developments of thesituation.
  1. In all command post exercises, require units to pass information back to the next higher echelon, using organic means of communication.
  1. Require all echelons to act on the factual or imaginary information furnished by executing their original plan of action, revising it, or calling for additional means.
  1. Adopt an attitude that the exercise is for the training of all, including the commander. Stress the fact that neither the commander nor any other leader can develop command. facility without practice, and that the command post exercise gives experience in correcting mistakes without causing the troops to suffer for them.
  1. Schedule command post exercises in any one echelon'only after the next lower echelon has become proficient in passing on the battle reports which actuate the situation for its commander.
  1. Use the chain of command in making necessary corrections in the progress of the exercise.
  1. Realize that, while a command post exercise may be held for a commander and his headquarters with only the next lower echelon present, the exercise will always benefit by the presence of as many headquarters as can be spared at that stage of training.
  1. Insist that staffs be used in a realistic manner to plan and supervise all phases of the exercise.

27. FIELD EXERCISES

1. General. Field exercises, particularly thosefor small units, provide the best training test ofcombat leadership ability and the best trainingexperience in developing it. Next to battle itself,they are the end toward which all training isdirected. Failure to stress this type of trainingresults in low standards of leadership beingbrought to the battlefield. The techniques of conducting field exercises are covered in appropriatetraining manuals. However, because of their direct relation to leadership training, the followingtechniques are given special emphasis.
1. Techniques.
  1. Stress realism. The modern battlefieldunder conditions of mobile warfare appears empty. Since the battlefield doesappear empty, normally plan exercises which involve an advance to seize terrainobjectives.
  1. Require repeated drills in the execution of simple tactical maneuvers designed to capture the planned objectives.
  1. Stress logical progression of training. Precede field exercises with instruction in evaluation of terrain, with combat orders, and with command post exercises drawn for the same terrain and situation.
  1. State the conditions of enemy fire which are supposed to exist over the ground traversed, or specific parts thereof. Do not introduce complicated artificialities; these only detract from the commander's ability to concentrate on the control of his unit and on the selection of a formation appropriate to the conditions of fire. The end in view is leadership ability as exemplified by facility in handling the unit.
  1. Stress the importance of each leader so placing himself and his headquarters that he can most readily coordinate all efforts of his command and of the elements that may be supporting it.
  1. Do not permit exercises against flagged enemy positions, or two-sided maneuvers, until leadership facility in command and control has been demonstrated.
  1. Wherever possible, employ current methods for marking support fires. Require that such marking, with accompanying movement, simulate battle conditions, if feasible.
  1. Stress the importance of exchange of information by all appropriate means.
  1. Have a well-planned critique immediately after each field exercise.

## Section V. LEADERSHIP IN DEMOBILIZATION

### DEMOBILIZATION

After each war, the Army is confronted withthe difficult problem of demobilization. Divergentand often conflicting objectives usually face theArmy at such a time. Some of these are

1. To return personnel to civilian life quickly.
2. To demobilize personnel in a just and fairorder.
3. To retain and maintain highly efficient forcesfor occupation duties and for other commitments
4. of armed security at home and abroad.
5. To care for billions of dollars worth of supplies and equipment, and to assist in the disposalof surplus.
6. To maintain morale in the Armed Forces andcivilian population.
7. To continue the induction or enlistment ofpersonnel as required.
8. To secure public acceptance of the demobilization plan.

### TECHNIQUES
Leadership techniques that particularly apply
to demobilization are

1. Early Planning in all Elements of the Command.

  1. The essence of a demobilization plan, regardless of the size of the military unitinvolved, is that it is fair and just to theindividual, does not leave a weak, ineffective defense force, and can be carried outexpeditiously with the means available.Mass demobilization procedures whichovertax facilities, both in the theater andin the continental United States, andwhich strip fighting and service units ofessential personnel are not justified solelybecause of personal desires. These desires, expressed individually or in mass,exert strong pressure for the rapid release of personnel from service withoutregard to military expediency.
  2. Early planning in division and highercommands is dependent upon directivesreceived from higher authority. It ishere that new leaders must be trained totake over the responsibilities of experienced demobilized veterans. All troopsmust be carefully oriented on the whyand how of the demobilization plan.
  3. Educationof Both Army Personneland Civilians. One of the most important objectives of ademobilization program is public acceptance. Although all Army personnel must know and understand the plan, basic support must come from thecivilian population. This support can be gainedonly by providing a sound, fair plan which is madeknown through a carefully conceived, forcefullyexecuted public information program. Initial impetus is gained through indoctrinating officersand men who will, in turn, inform friends andrelatives. Continuous emphasis must be placed onthe responsibilities of the Armed Forces for furthering national interest. The press and the public must be solidly behind procedures of the demobilization plan.
  4. Fairness to the Individual. A war of any appreciable duration will find practically all unitscontaining personnel with wide differences in age,service, and family responsibility. If, at the endof any future war, demobilization is based on individual criteria, those parts of the plan dealingwith the interests of individuals must be plannedand executed fairly.
  5. Maintenance of Morale and Esprit de corps.Any method of demobilization based entirely onindividual criteria will ultimately destroy groupidentity. This is true not only of units that areselected to remain in being, but also of units thatare used as vehicles for returning individualsfor demobilization. Large groups of personnel willsuddenly find themselves among strangers, instrange surroundings, and under strange leaders.

Some methods that may prove useful in such unitsfor builaing and maintaining morale and esprit decorps are

  1. To keep troops busy on useful work.
  1. To separate as quickly as possible personnel to be demobilized from those whoare to remain in the service.
  1. To make every effort to insure that demobilization plans work smoothly.
  1. To make men leaving the Army feel thattheir service has been appreciated andthat every effort has been made to separate them from the service in an efficientmanner.
  1. To indoctrinate remaining men with theimportance of their work and service.

### ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR UNITS COMPOSEDOF PERSONNEL TO BE DEMOBILIZED

1. Welcome veterans to the unit. Foster a"sense of belonging" among those assigned fromother units.
2. Orient and inform personnel. Officers andmen must be kept informed of the status of demobilization as it affects them and of any reasonsfor delays which may develop.
3. Include preparation for return to civilian lifein training. Courses of study in civilian pursuitsshould be made available. Training should promote the health of the individual, and disciplineand pride in his unit.
4. Provide good food, billets, living conditions,and recreation.
5. Stress discipline, appearance, saluting, uniform, and unit athletics. Encourage men to wearservice ribbons, decorations, and any other authorized symbols of previous service. Where practicable, arrange for officers and men from the samecombat unit to remain together until separationfrom the service.
6. Avoid rash promises and commitments.Keep in mind that the best of plans go astray forunforeseen reasons.
7. Avoid changes and counterorders. By thorough planning, seek stability for the unit and forits individuals. Keep changes in orders and shiftsof personnel to a minimum.

## Section VI. LEADERSHIP OF OCCUPATION FORCES

### OCCUPATION MISSIONS

Primary missions of occupation forces are tosupport the military government of the occupiedterritory and to protect that territory from external aggression and from internal uprising.Secondary missions may include supervising andregulating certain activities of the inhabitants ofthe occupied territory; supervising and directingessential rehabilitation and reconstruction; supplying necessities to the population; controllingborders; supporting civil police; and conductingtraining not only to fit the forces for carrying outtheir occupation missions, but also to maintain
them as capable combat forces.

### SPECIAL FACTORS

Some factors peculiar to occupationwhich bear on leadership are

a. Foreign Duty. A large proportion of thetroops may not be serving overseas from choice.The foreign population may naturally resent thepresence of an occupying force and may oppose itby various means.
b. Incentive. Generally, it is difficult to converttroops from their combat missions to those of occupation. The commander must expect a naturallet-down of interest on the part of the occupationtroops if no new incentives are provided and accepted by them.
c. Availability of Forces. The early stages ofthe occupation are likely to be characterized by anabundance of troops for occupation tasks. Later ashortage may exist. Furthermore, a rapid turnover of personnel of the occupation forces may result from short-term enlistments, time requiredfor training replacements in the continentalUnited States, shipping time from the continentalUnited States, demobilization criteria, and otherfactors beyond the control of the occupation forcecommanders. These factors will increase thetraining problems of the occupation forces, particularly with respect to junior officers and noncommissioned officers.
d. Maintenance of High Standards of Discipline. Not only is it necessary to carry out thenormal administrative duties of occupation efficiently, but also it is essential to gain and maintainthe respect of the conquered populace. A highlydisciplined force will have little trouble controllingthose who respect its military efficiency.

### TECHNIQUES TO BE EMPHASIZED

All leadership techniques discussed previouslyapply equally well to the commander of occupationforces. Some additional techniques are
1. To keep occupation forces informed of thepurpose and importance of their mission.
2. To do everything possible to make the tour ofoccupation duty interesting for the command. Provide recreation facilities, tours within the occupiedand adjacent countries, comfortable billets, goodfood, and freedom from menial tasks that can beperformed by the conquered population. Provideinstruction for the troops in the language of theoccupied country.
3. To treat the civil population fairly, firmly,and courteously. Proper relations will greatly assist in breaking down the people's natural resentment towards occupation forces.
4. To keep troops busy on essential work andtraining, or at interesting and wholesome recreation.
5. To provide the best in uniforms, arms, andequipment, and insist upon outstanding appearance.
6. To select leaders carefully. Popularity alonewithin the unit is one of the poorest criterions inthese selections.
7. To demonstrate to your command that youare part of it. The failures of the men are yourfailures, and their successes are likewise yours.

## Section VII. LEADERSHIP OF MINORITY GROUPS

### MINORITY GROUPS

Within our nation there are many groups whichare considered minority groups-racial, religious,and cultural. Since the Army's concern is only theemployment of men on their individual merit sothat they may contribute most efficiently and effectively to the national effort, it follows that theArmy's interest in any minority group extendsonly to distinctive differences which may necessitate special handling. These differences lie in suchfactors as general ability, physical strength, dietneeds, mechanical skills, language, and education.The problem of using certain minority groups withgreater efficiency has caused grave concern duringthe past two wars. In a future war, this problemmay be of greater magnitude. For this considerable portion of our National manpower resources,the Army must accept the responsibility for providing competent leadership. At the same time,leaders must avoid any effort to foster social experiments within the structure of the MilitaryEstablishment except when expressly ordered byhigher authority to do so. The principles in chap ter 1 apply to the leading of any minority group inthe United States. The greatest sources of difficulty lie in the lack of thorough understanding ofthe characteristics of the group, and in the failureto recognize the fact that individual differencesare greater and more significant than are groupdifferences.

### TECHNIQUES

A need for outstanding leadership is imperativein units composed of personnel from recognizedminority groups. This need cannot be met by increased quantity of leaders alone; the quality ofleadership must be of the highest order. The following techniques are presented for the purposeof amplifying the basic principles of leadershipand of applying them to minority group units:
a. Recognize that all soldiers are entitled toidentical treatment and to fundamental rights,privileges, and opportunities regardless of differences in race, color, creed, or cultural background.To accept less for your unit invites unfavorablecriticism; to demand more creates an undesirablereaction from all elements.
b. Set the example in tolerance, understanding,and freedom from prejudice. Become worthy ofbeing emulated as a broad-minded, unprejudicedleader.
c. Avoid creating the impression of either hostility or patronizing condescension.
d. Develop an understanding of minority groupproblems and feelings by observation and study.

It is only by first-hand knowledge that any race orgroup may be understood. Diligent study of groupproblems tends to destroy false beliefs and conceptions.

1. Develop in your men initiative and a sense ofresponsibility by providing means and opportunities for fostering and improving these traits.
2. Impress your unit with the fact that theArmy is concerned primarily with the developmentof soldiers and leaders and that each man will beafforded opportunity to develop his own capabilities and capacities.
3. Be sure that adequate provisions are madefor off-duty time. When civilian facilities arelimited or restricted, increase the military recreational program accordingly.
4. Be patient in training progress. It is betterto build slowly toward high standards than toneglect details.
5. Maintain the same standards as are requiredof comparable units.

## Section VIII. LEADERSHIP OF FEMALE GROUPS

### FEMALE GROUPS

While WAC's, nurses, and female civilian employees, Red Cross workers, and USO entertainersdo not constitute a minority group, their presencewith the Army poses certain problems of leader ship. Individually, or as a group, women requirecertain facilities and items not essential to malepersonnel; among these are-special facilities forbilleting, transportation, hospitalization, and recreation, and special items of individual equipmentand supply. The particulars concerning leadership of women are contained in appropriate publications prepared by the Women's Army Corps.
