## PURPOSE OF THE STUDY OF LEADERSHIP

Today, more than ever in history, the Army is in need of leadership of the highest caliber. With the increase in the complexity of warfare, the science of war is increasingly dependent upon human guidance. No matter how complicated it may become, war is always waged by men. The man who leads and the men who are led win wars. Every member of our military force must be a leader, actually or potentially.

The purpose of this manual is to provide military leaders, actual and prospective, with a practical guide for applying the principles of leadership.In the ultimate sense, leadership is not inherent; it depends upon traits which can be developed, and upon the application of techniques which can be learned.It is an art which can be acquired, cultivated, and practiced by anyone who possesses the mental and physical ability and the moral and ethical integrity expected of a commissioned or noncommissioned officer. Developing the art is a continuing process which involves the recognition and practice of the basic traits of leadership and the understanding and application of sound leadership principles and techniques.

This manual stresses the importance of self improvement. The principles, character traits, and procedures set forth are offered as an assistance to the leader in the problem of controlling others. By applying these procedures to his own practice and by analyzing his own traits of character the leader will possess a yardstick for measuring his own success or failure.

Despite this guide, it constantly must be borne in mind that successful leaders of the past were not all of the same pattern; nor did they all use the same methods of attaining success. All of them, however, consciously or unconsciously understood the basic concepts of leadership and successfully practiced many of the techniques presented in this
manual.

The principles and techniques presented herein are the result of an analysis of outstanding leadership displayed by successful leaders, both military and civilian, of this and other countries. Thorough study of these, combined with actual practice with troops, will develop and foster the high standard of leadership so urgently demanded by our Army today.
