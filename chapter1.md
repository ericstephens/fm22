## CHARACTERISTICS OF LEADERSHIP

1. Essential Nature of Leadership. The military profession has no monopoly on leadership. In every walk of life, in every industry, in every government, in every phase of human endeavor, there are leaders and there are followers. Progress and success are dependent upon the quality and efficacy of leadership.
2. Elements of Leadership. Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior-the ability to handle men. The art of influencing behavior, the
must be rejected. Leadership is intangible only to the extent that we make it so. Any reasonably intelligent, morally sound, forceful man, no matter how inexperienced, can become acquainted with the component elements of leadership. These elements may be studied, practiced, learned, and applied, just as any other human accomplishment
may be learned and mastered.
3. The Leader and the Small Group. Every leader, whether civilian or military, actually maintains close personal contact with only a small group, regardless of the number of men ultimately controlled by him. Inevitably, he must depend upon that small group in order to make his will known and to execute his purp se. In the realm of the military, we refer to the small group as immediate subordinates and staff.
4. Military Leadership. Military leadership is the art of influencing and directing men to an assigned goal in such a way as to obtain their obedience, confidence, respect, and loyal cooperation. It is indispensable to success in combat. Like all leadership, it is dependent upon personal traits and upon the application of recognized techniques. The personal traits can be developed, and the techniques can be learned.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMAND AND LEADERSHIP

1. Authoritarian and Persuasive Leadership. There are two kinds of leadership, authoritarian and persuasive. One who is predominantly of the authoritarian type normally is recognized by the dogmatic use of authority or power. The persuasive type of leadership takes into consideration the human element with all its complexity and with all its differentiation of the physical, mental, and moral capabilities and limitations of the individual. To a great extent, the persuasive leader bases his skill in leadership upon example and ability, with high standards of discipline and efficiency for himself as well as for his followers. This manual is concerned solely with the development of the persuasive type of leadership.
1. The Exercise of Command. Command is the authority that a member of the military professionlawfully exerts over subordinates by virtue of his rank and assignment. Leadership can be exercised by any one at any time irrespective of the framework of command. It is recognized that in any group some individual will emerge as the leader, even though no command or organizational structure is present. Individuals in coordinate capacities exercise leadership in their dealing with their equals outside the immediate command structure. In general, however, we think of military leadership as being exercised within the command framework. Therefore, in one sense, military leadership is the proper exercise of command.
1. Accompaniments of Command. Command in the Army is accompanied by responsibility involving special trust and confidence. Command, with its ramifications of administration, planning, executing, supervising, and coordinating, is the primary reason for the military leader's existence. The leader is responsible not only for initiating action, but for supervising all activities within his command. In this responsibility for the general administration of a group, it is his duty to receive, comply with, and execute instructions with exactness and thoroughness, regardless of his personal feelings.

## OBJECTIVE OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP

The objective of military leadership is the creation and maintenance of an organization which will loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task assigned or indicated, and will initiatesuitable action in the absence of orders. The proper application of the principles of leadership to a command can create an efficient well-disciplined organization possessing high morale and esprit de corps.

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF LEADERSHIP

1. General. The responsibilities of the leader are twofold-accomplishment of his mission, and the fulfillment of his responsibilities to his men. Man is the fundamental instrument of war. Other instruments may change, new weapons may be created and new modes of defense may be devised, but man, the fundamental instrument, remains constant. The leader must be concerned with the desires, needs, and mental state of his men. If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior; if he appreciates that most men react infixed and definite ways under a given stimulus or influence; if he recognizes, develops, and applies those traits of character which will produce the correct reactions in his men, he will possess the basic tools for managing men-he will be a leader. Since effective leadership in battle is the ultimate goal of military leadership, it is obvious that, regardless of the leader's ability to dominate or persuade, his success inevitably depends upon his skill in the tactical control of his unit. Tactical control is a technique developed by study and by practice.
1. Accomplishment of the Mission. The primary duty of the leader is the accomplishment ofhis assigned mission. Everything else, even the welfare of his men, is subordinate.
1. Duties to the Men. The next responsibility of the leader lies in his duty to his men. It is rarely possible to accomplish any mission without attention to the morale and esprit of the men. In the military service, the follower is peculiarly dependent upon his leader; he can do little to improve his lot if his leader neglects him.

## INDICATIONS OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP

There are four characteristics of a command that are accurate indications of success or failure in the exercise of leadership. These qualities are discipline, morale, esprit de corps, and degree of efficiency.

1. Discipline. Military discipline is a state of order and obedience existing within a command.It involves the ready subordination of the will of the individual for the good of the group. Military discipline is an extension and a specialized application of the discipline of any organized society. True discipline demands habitual but reasoned obedience to command, an obedience that preserves initiative and functions unfalteringly even in the absence of the commander. Discipline is created within a command by training, by judicious use of punishment and reward, and by instilling a sense of confidence and responsibility in each individual. Discipline demands correct performance of duty. The need for discipline is best inculcated in an individual by appealing to his sense of reason. In the few instances where appeal to reason fails, the use of punishment is effective in causing the recalcitrant individual to conform and perhaps to appreciate the need for discipline. Commendation and earned praise from the senior to his subordinate, either individually or collectively, for a task well done, serve to strengthen the disciplinary bonds which bind together the smooth-functioning team.
1. Morale. Morale is a mental and emotional state. The importance of morale cannot be overestimated since it is a great contributing factor to the efficiency of a unit. Good morale is indicated by
  1. Zeal, or the voluntary effort which men give to their tasks over and beyond the perfunctory obedience to commands and regulations.
  1. A basic sense of personal worth founded on confidence in leaders, training, weapons, and equipment.
  1. Satisfaction, or the pride of the individual in the accomplishment of the assigned mission.
1. Esprit de corps. Esprit de corps is the mental and emotional state of the unit. It is distinguished from morale, which is described as the mental and emotional state of the individual. Esprit de corps is not a simple summation of the morale of the individuals in the unit. Rather, it results from the total interaction of the personnel of the unit toward one another and with the circumstances in which the unit is placed. When unit esprit is high, the collective goals of the unit overshadow those of the individual members. In such instances, the personal dissatisfactions of some individuals are overshadowed by the prevailing group spirit. Unit achievement, both past and present, is a strong force in raising esprit de corps. A unit with a high esprit de corps can accomplish its mission in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds. Esprit de corps is enhanced when the group identification is increased and, conversely, is lowered when it is decreased. It has been proved that pride in the unit was the outstanding manifestation of good morale in World War II; this was accompanied by good officer-enlisted personnel relationships.
1. Efficiency. Efficiency is the ability to accomplish successfully an assigned task in the shortest possible time, with the minimum expenditure of means, and with the least possible confusion.Efficiency in a command is built by sound training and by effective administration. It is enhanced by good discipline, high morale, and esprit de corps.

## ROLE OF PSYCHOLOGY

Leadership is closely linked with psychology, the study of human behavior. Proved principles of leadership include proved principles of psychology. It is known that human beings tend to react similarly under a given set of conditions. From a leadership standpoint, some of these reactions are favorable, some unfavorable. With a knowledge of how human beings tend to respond to a particular set of circumstances and with a comprehension of the basic factors that control human behavior, the leader can capitalize on favorable reactions and minimize tendencies toward unfavorable ones. It is evident therefore that a knowledge of psychology is helpful to the leader.

## ROLE OF ETHICS

Ethics, the science of moral duty, is closely allied with the art of leadership. In order to set the example for his men and to win their confidence and respect, the leader must be capable of deciding whether a given course of action is morally right or wrong. A knowledge of ethics will materially assist the leader in making such a decision. It will insure against his losing stature in the eyes of his command by embarking upon a course of action that is contrary to moral principles. Temporizing with principles and moral standards may secure a temporary advantage, or fleeting popularity. But in the end only strict adherence to high standards of honor and integrity will prove of value to the leader.
