# CHAPTER 2 FUNDAMENTALS OF LEADERSHIP

## Section I. LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES AND TRAITS

### LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES

Leadership principles apply equally in all commands. These are:
1. Principle I. Know your job.
1. Principle II. Know yourself and seek self improvement.
1. Principle III. Know your men and look out for their welfare.
1. Principle IV. Keep your men informed.
1. Principle V. Set the example.
1. Principle VI. Insure that the task is understood, supervised, and accomplished.
1. Principle VII. Train your men as a team.
1. Principle VIII. Make sound and timely decisions.
1. Principle IX. Seek responsibility and develop a sense of responsibility among subordinates.
1. Principle X. Employ your command in accordance with its capabilities.
1. Principle XI. Take responsibility for your actions.

### DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP

The principles of leadership discussed below are equally applicable to all levels of command from the squad to the army group.

1. Principle I - Know Your Job. To know his job thoroughly, the leader must possess a wide field of knowledge. He must understand the technical aspects of the operation of his command and the methods and procedures of organization, administration, instruction, and personnel management. The leader also should possess a sound understanding of human relations. Further, he should have a working knowledge of the duties, responsibilities, and problems of his subordinates.If he commands a service unit, he should have a knowledge of combat operations.
1. Principle II - Know Yourself and Seek Self improvement. It is the duty of every leader to evaluate himself and to recognize his strengths and weaknesses. An individual who does not know his own capabilities and limitations is not master of himself and can never hope to be a leader. Likewise, an individual who realizes hisdeficiencies but makes no effort to correct themwill fail as a leader. Study of leadership principlesand practice of sound leadership techniques willdevelop leadership ability.
1. Principle III - Know Your Men and Look outfor Their Welfare. By making a conscientiouseffort to observe the members of his command asoften as possible, to become personally acquainted with them, to recognize their individual differences, and to share in their joys and sorrows, theleader will have a better understanding of how hissubordinates react and function under variousconditions. He then will be able to employ themmore effectively. By assuring himself that themembers of his command are as comfortable, wellcared for, and contented as circumstances will permit, the leader wins their confidence, respect, andcooperation. By neglecting their welfare, theleader indicates indifference and, as a consequence,forfeits the trust and confidence of his men.
1. Principle IV - Keep Your Men Informed. The soldier who is well informed about the mission and situation and about the purpose of hisparticular task is considerably more effective thanthe one who is not so informed. The better he isinformed, the better he can perform his tasks withmaximum initiative. The commander who fails tomake essential information available to his menwill soon find that they are performing blindlywithout purpose. At the same time, commandersat all levels must realize that security requirements impose limitations on information whichmay be imparted to the men.
1. Principle V - Set the Example. Men instinctively look to their leaders for patterns of conductwhich they may either emulate or use as an excusefor their own shortcomings. The classic exampleof the military leader is that of an individualwhose appearance and conduct evoke from his subordinates, praise, pride, and the desire to emulate him. By his outstanding performance of duty, theleader must set the standard for the entire command. The commander who appears in an unfavorable light before his men destroys the respectthat must exist mutually between him and his menbefore leadership can be exercised.
1. Principle VI - Insure That the Task is Understood, Supervised, and Accomplished. The leadermust give clear, concise orders that cannot be misunderstood; then, by close supervision, he mustinsure that those orders are properly executed.The issuance of an order is the initial and relatively small part of the commander's responsibility. His principal responsibility lies in supervision to make sure that the order is properly executed. It is this responsibility that is most difficult to carry out. The able leader will make wiseuse of his subordinates to carry out his supervision effectively. Any commander of a large unitwho fails to make proper and adequate use of hisstaff and subordinates demonstrates a fundamental weakness in leadership ability.
1. Principle VII - Train Your Men as a Team.The duty of every leader includes the developmentof teamwork through the thorough training ofhis command, whether it be a-squad or an armygroup. Modern armies are complex organizationsinvolving many different arms and services, allworking together as a team toward a common end.Each part of the team must understand where itfits into the common effort. The commander whofails to foster teamwork while training his com mand will not obtain the desired degree of unitefficiency.
1. Principle VIII - Make Sound and Timely Decisions. The ability to make a rapid estimate ofthe situation and arrive at a sound decision is essential to a leader. He must be able to reasonlogically under the most trying conditions. Hemust decide quickly what action is necessary inorder to take advantage of opportunities as theyoccur. The vacillating commander not only willbe unable to employ his command effectively butwill create vacillation, lack of confidence, hesitancy, and indecision, within the command itself.The ability to make sound and timely decisionscan be acquired by constant study and by trainingin making estimates. On the other hand, whencircumstances dictate a change in plans, the ableleader will act promptly without fear that thecommand may consider such action as a vacillation.
1. Principle IX - Seek Responsibility and Develop a Sense of Responsibility Among Subordinates. The leader must be quick to seize the initiative in the absence of instructions from his superior. By seeking responsibility, the leader developshimself professionally and increases his potentialability. Proper delegation of authority is a soundattribute of leadership. The commander then holdshis subordinate strictly responsible for results,and rarely for methods of procedure. Such actionby the commander engenders trust, faith, and confidence. It develops initiative and wholehearted cooperation. Reluctance to delegate authorityoften is a mark of retarded growth in leadership.
1. Principle X - Employ Your Command in Accordance With its Capabilities. To employ hiscommand properly, the leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical and administrativecapabilities and limitations of his command. Hemust assign objectives that are possible of attainment, properly evaluate time and space factors,and employ his command with sound judgment.To do less than this may spell failure in accomplishing the mission. Recurrent failure bringsabout collapse of morale, esprit de corps, and efficiency. However, on occasion, when the situationdemands, men must be pushed without hesitationbeyond their considered capabilities in order toachieve a quick and cheap victory or to avoid acostly defeat.
1. Principle XI - Take Responsibility for YourActions. The commander of a unit is responsiblefor all his unit does, or fails to do. The leaderrecognizes and acknowledges this responsibilityon all occasions. Any effort to evade this responsibility destroys the bond of loyalty and respect thatmust exist between the commander and his subordinates.

### LEADERSHIP TRAITS

Leadership traits are human qualities that areof great value to the leader. Possession of thesetraits simplifies the task of applying leadershipprinciples and assists greatly in winning confi dence, respect, and cooperation. An individual canbenefit by studying the traits considered importantto the leader. By careful self-analysis and application, he can develop those traits in which he is deficient and further strengthen those in which he isstrong. A study of our Nation's great militaryleaders reveals that none possessed all the leadership traits to the maximum degree, but that aweakness in some traits was more than compensated for by strength in others. Critical selfanalysis will enable an individual to realize thetraits in which he is strong and to capitalize uponthem. At the same time, he must endeavor to improve those traits in which he is weak. The following list of leadership traits is by no means allinclusive but does contain those of paramount importance to the leader:
1. Alertness is vigilance, promptness, and wideawakeness.
2. Bearing denotes desirable physical appearance, dress, and deportment.
3. Couragemust be both physical and moral.
4. Decisiveness is the ability to make decisionspromptly when indicated and announce them authoritatively, concisely, and clearly.
5. Dependability is the doing of one's duty withor without supervision.
6. Endurance both mental and physical, is necessary to continue and complete any reasonable
7. task.
8. Enthusiasm is the positive zeal or interest inthe task at hand. It is easily communicated tosubordinates.
9. Force is the ability to impose one's will upon another.
11. Humility is freedom from arrogance and unjustifiable pride.
12. Humor is the capacity to appreciate the manyamusing or whimsical happenings of our everyday life, especially those which pertain to theleader himself.
13. Initiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders and to offer well-considered recommendations for the improvement of the command.
14. Integrity is the honesty and moral characterof the leader that must be unquestioned.
15. Intelligence is the intellect of the leaderwhich must be adequate to master the problemspresented by his level of command.
16. Judgment is the power of the mind to weighvarious factors and arrive at a wise decision.
17. Justice is being equitable and impartial in bestowing favors and punishment.
18. Loyalty must extend both up and down. Aleader cannot expect loyalty from his subordinatesunless he is conspicuously loyal to them and to hissuperiors.
19. Sympathy is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is associated.
20. Tact is the ability to deal with subordinatesand superiors in an appropriate manner withoutgiving offense.
21. Unselfishness is the studied avoidance of caring for or providing for one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others.

## Section II. LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES

### GENERAL

1. It is important to note that in small units theleader can influence and direct his men throughclose personal contact, whereas in large units hemust rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate commanders to assist him in making hisleadership effective. The larger the unit, the morecomplex become the problems of leadership, butthe greater become the means available to the commander to assist him in the exercise of leadership.The larger unit commander must consider carefully the leadership aspect of all basic policieswhich he prescribes or tolerates.

1. Obviously, it is not feasible to cite all possibleleadership techniques pertinent to a particularleadership principle, since techniques vary withthe size of the command, the personality of thecommander, and the situation. In the followingparagraphs, some of the more common techniquesare listed under each principle. These techniquesare methods of applying a principle that are effective under most circumstances. Over a period oftime, the leader will develop techniques of his ownwhich will be better suited to his own personalityand which he himself will be able to employ effectively.
