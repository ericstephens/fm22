# CHAPTER 2 FUNDAMENTALS OF LEADERSHIP

## Section I. LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES AND TRAITS

### LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES

Leadership principles apply equally in all commands. These are:
1. Principle I. Know your job.
1. Principle II. Know yourself and seek self-improvement.
1. Principle III. Know your men and look out for their welfare.
1. Principle IV. Keep your men informed.
1. Principle V. Set the example.
1. Principle VI. Insure that the task is understood, supervised, and accomplished.
1. Principle VII. Train your men as a team.
1. Principle VIII. Make sound and timely decisions.
1. Principle IX. Seek responsibility and develop a sense of responsibility among subordinates.
1. Principle X. Employ your command in accordance with its capabilities.
1. Principle XI. Take responsibility for your actions.

### DISCUSSION OF PRINCIPLES OF MILITARY LEADERSHIP

The principles of leadership discussed below are equally applicable to all levels of command from the squad to the army group.

1. Principle I - Know Your Job. To know his job thoroughly, the leader must possess a wide field of knowledge. He must understand the technical aspects of the operation of his command and the methods and procedures of organization, administration, instruction, and personnel management. The leader also should possess a sound understanding of human relations. Further, he should have a working knowledge of the duties, responsibilities, and problems of his subordinates. If he commands a service unit, he should have a knowledge of combat operations.
1. Principle II - Know Yourself and Seek Self improvement. It is the duty of every leader to evaluate himself and to recognize his strengths and weaknesses. An individual who does not know his own capabilities and limitations is not master of himself and can never hope to be a leader. Likewise, an individual who realizes his deficiencies but makes no effort to correct them will fail as a leader. Study of leadership principles and practice of sound leadership techniques will develop leadership ability.
1. Principle III - Know Your Men and Look out for Their Welfare. By making a conscientious effort to observe the members of his command as often as possible, to become personally acquainted with them, to recognize their individual differences, and to share in their joys and sorrows, the leader will have a better understanding of how his subordinates react and function under various conditions. He then will be able to employ them more effectively. By assuring himself that the members of his command are as comfortable, well cared for, and contented as circumstances will permit, the leader wins their confidence, respect, and cooperation. By neglecting their welfare, the leader indicates indifference and, as a consequence, forfeits the trust and confidence of his men.
1. Principle IV - Keep Your Men Informed. The soldier who is well informed about the mission and situation and about the purpose of his particular task is considerably more effective than the one who is not so informed. The better he is informed, the better he can perform his tasks with maximum initiative. The commander who fails to make essential information available to his men will soon find that they are performing blindly without purpose. At the same time, commanders at all levels must realize that security requirements impose limitations on information which may be imparted to the men.
1. Principle V - Set the Example. Men instinctively look to their leaders for patterns of conduct which they may either emulate or use as an excuse for their own shortcomings. The classic example of the military leader is that of an individual whose appearance and conduct evoke from his subordinates, praise, pride, and the desire to emulate him. By his outstanding performance of duty, the leader must set the standard for the entire command. The commander who appears in an unfavorable light before his men destroys the respect that must exist mutually between him and his men before leadership can be exercised.
1. Principle VI - Insure That the Task is Understood, Supervised, and Accomplished. The leader must give clear, concise orders that cannot be misunderstood; then, by close supervision, he must insure that those orders are properly executed. The issuance of an order is the initial and relatively small part of the commander's responsibility. His principal responsibility lies in supervision to make sure that the order is properly executed. It is this responsibility that is most difficult to carry out. The able leader will make wise use of his subordinates to carry out his supervision effectively. Any commander of a large unit who fails to make proper and adequate use of his staff and subordinates demonstrates a fundamental weakness in leadership ability.
1. Principle VII - Train Your Men as a Team. The duty of every leader includes the development of teamwork through the thorough training of his command, whether it be a-squad or an army group. Modern armies are complex organizations involving many different arms and services, all working together as a team toward a common end. Each part of the team must understand where it fits into the common effort. The commander who fails to foster teamwork while training his command will not obtain the desired degree of unit efficiency.
1. Principle VIII - Make Sound and Timely Decisions. The ability to make a rapid estimate of the situation and arrive at a sound decision is essential to a leader. He must be able to reason logically under the most trying conditions. He must decide quickly what action is necessary in order to take advantage of opportunities as they occur. The vacillating commander not only will be unable to employ his command effectively but will create vacillation, lack of confidence, hesitancy, and indecision, within the command itself. The ability to make sound and timely decisions can be acquired by constant study and by training in making estimates. On the other hand, when circumstances dictate a change in plans, the able leader will act promptly without fear that the command may consider such action as a vacillation.
1. Principle IX - Seek Responsibility and Develop a Sense of Responsibility Among Subordinates. The leader must be quick to seize the initiative in the absence of instructions from his superior. By seeking responsibility, the leader develops himself professionally and increases his potential ability. Proper delegation of authority is a sound at tribute of leadership. The commander then holds his subordinate strictly responsible for results, and rarely for methods of procedure. Such action by the commander engenders trust, faith, and confidence. It develops initiative and wholehearted cooperation. Reluctance to delegate authority often is a mark of retarded growth in leadership.
1. Principle X - Employ Your Command in Accordance With its Capabilities. To employ his command properly, the leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical and administrative capabilities and limitations of his command. He must assign objectives that are possible of attainment, properly evaluate time and space factors, and employ his command with sound judgment. To do less than this may spell failure in accomplishing the mission. Recurrent failure brings about collapse of morale, esprit de corps, and efficiency. However, on occasion, when the situation demands, men must be pushed without hesitation beyond their considered capabilities in order to achieve a quick and cheap victory or to avoid a costly defeat.
1. Principle XI - Take Responsibility for Your Actions. The commander of a unit is responsible for all his unit does, or fails to do. The leader recognizes and acknowledges this responsibility on all occasions. Any effort to evade this responsibility destroys the bond of loyalty and respect that must exist between the commander and his subordinates.

### LEADERSHIP TRAITS

Leadership traits are human qualities that are of great value to the leader. Possession of these traits simplifies the task of applying leadership principles and assists greatly in winning confidence, respect, and cooperation. An individual can benefit by studying the traits considered important to the leader. By careful self-analysis and application, he can develop those traits in which he is deficient and further strengthen those in which he is strong. A study of our Nation's great military leaders reveals that none possessed all the leadership traits to the maximum degree, but that a weakness in some traits was more than compensated for by strength in others. Critical self-analysis will enable an individual to realize the traits in which he is strong and to capitalize upon them. At the same time, he must endeavor to improve those traits in which he is weak. The following list of leadership traits is by no means all-inclusive but does contain those of paramount importance to the leader:
1. Alertness is vigilance, promptness, and wide awakeness.
2. Bearing denotes desirable physical appearance, dress, and deportment.
3. Courage must be both physical and moral.
4. Decisiveness is the ability to make decisions promptly when indicated and announce them authoritatively, concisely, and clearly.
5. Dependability is the doing of one's duty with or without supervision.
6. Endurance both mental and physical, is necessary to continue and complete any reasonable
7. task.
8. Enthusiasm is the positive zeal or interest in the task at hand. It is easily communicated to subordinates.
9. Force is the ability to impose one's will upon another.
11. Humility is freedom from arrogance and unjustifiable pride.
12. Humor is the capacity to appreciate the many amusing or whimsical happenings of our everyday life, especially those which pertain to the leader himself.
13. Initiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders and to offer well-considered recommendations for the improvement of the command.
14. Integrity is the honesty and moral character of the leader that must be unquestioned.
15. Intelligence is the intellect of the leader which must be adequate to master the problem presented by his level of command.
16. Judgment is the power of the mind to weigh various factors and arrive at a wise decision.
17. Justice is being equitable and impartial in bestowing favors and punishment.
18. Loyalty must extend both up and down. A leader cannot expect loyalty from his subordinates unless he is conspicuously loyal to them and to his superiors.
19. Sympathy is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is associated.
20. Tact is the ability to deal with subordinates and superiors in an appropriate manner without giving offense.

21. Unselfishness is the studied avoidance of caring for or providing for one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others.

## Section II. LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES

### GENERAL

1. It is important to note that in small units the leader can influence and direct his men through close personal contact, whereas in large units he must rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate commanders to assist him in making his leadership effective. The larger the unit, the more complex become the problems of leadership, but the greater become the means available to the commander to assist him in the exercise of leadership. The larger unit commander must consider carefully the leadership aspect of all basic policies which he prescribes or tolerates.

1. Obviously, it is not feasible to cite all possible leadership techniques pertinent to a particular leadership principle, since techniques vary with the size of the command, the personality of the commander, and the situation. In the following paragraphs, some of the more common techniques are listed under each principle. These techniques are methods of applying a principle that are effective under most circumstances. Over a period of time, the leader will develop techniques of his own which will be better suited to his own personality and which he himself will be able to employ effectively.

### LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL LEADERS

#### Principle I - Know Your Job.
1. Seek a well-rounded military education through attendance at service schools and through independent reading, research, and study.
2. Keep abreast of latest techniques in the field of communication in order to facilitate control of your unit and to disseminate information.
3. Seek out and foster association with capable leaders. Observe and study their actions and application of leadership techniques.
4. Broaden your field of knowledge through association with officers and men of other arms and services.
5. Seek opportunity to apply knowledge through the exercise of command. Real leadership is acquired only through constant practice.
6. Avoid overspecialization in too narrow a field.
7. Keep abreast of current military developments.
8. Familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of all elements of your command, by study and through frequent visits to subordinates.

#### Principle II - Know Yourself and Seek Self-improvement.
1. Analyze yourself objectively to determine the strong and weak points of your character.
1. Recognize your weak points and make an effort to overcome them.
1. Solicit, when appropriate, the candid opinions of others as to how you can make the most of your desirable qualities and eliminate the undesirable ones.
.+?\. Profit by studying the causes for the success or failure of other leaders past and present.
1. Develop a genuine interest in people; acquire the human touch.
1. Practice the "Golden Rule."
1. Master the art of good writing and speaking.
1. Cultivate cordial relations with members of the other arms and services and with civilians.

#### Principle III - Know Your Men and Look out for Their Welfare.
1. See the members of your command and let them see you; be friendly and approachable.
1. Develop an intimate knowledge and understanding of your subordinates through personal contact and available records. In small commands, it is imperative not only that the leader know and address his subordinates by name, but also that he be familiar with their characteristics.
1. Interest yourself in the living conditions of the members of your command, including their family environment, food, clothing, and billeting.
1. Make ample provision for, and give personal and visible attention to, the various personnel services, particularly those concerned with the personal problems of individuals.
1. Provide for the spiritual welfare of your command by supporting religious activities.
1. Protect the health of your command by active supervision of hygiene, and sanitation.
1. Support actively a safety program.
1. Determine the mental attitude of members of your command by frequent informal visits and by using fully all available sources of information.
1. Administer justice impartially to all without fear or favor. When punishment is necessary, the commander should(a) Be fair, consistent, and impersonal.
  - Punish in private, with dignity and with human understanding.
  - Never award degrading punishment.

- Avoid punishing a group for the faults of an individual.
  - Always make the individual feel that the punishment is temporary, and that improvement is expected.
1. Insure fair and equitable distribution of privileges such as passes, leaves, and rotation.
1. Encourage educational development by providing educational opportunities for members of your command.

#### Principle IV-Keep Your Men Informed.
1. Explain to your principal subordinates why any particular task must be accomplished and how you propose to do it.
1. Assure yourself by frequent inspections and visits that subordinates are transmitting necessary information to the men.
1. Keep your principal subordinates informed of plans for future operations, subject only to security restrictions.
1. Disseminate information concerning the capabilities of our weapons compared to those of an active or potential enemy. Where an enemy has an initial advantage, show how this can be overcome.
1. Be sure the troops are informed of the capabilities and limitations of supporting units, arms, and services.
1. Be alert to detect the spread of false rumors. Stop rumors by replacing them with truth.
1. Build confidence and esprit de corps by exploiting all information concerning successes of the command.

#### Principle V - Set the Example.
1. Be at all times physically fit, mentally alert, well groomed, and correctly dressed.
1. Master your emotions. The commander who is subject to intemperate bursts of anger or to periods of depression will have difficulty in gaining and holding the respect and loyalty of his subordinates.
1. Maintain an optimistic outlook. The will to win is infectious. The leader fosters it by capitalizing on his unit's capabilities and successes, not on its limitations or failures. Maintain an air of outward calmness. The more difficult the situation, the more important this becomes.
1. Conduct yourself so that your personal habits are not open to censure. Coarse behavior and vulgarity are the marks of an essentially weak and unstable character; these, together with a failure to be punctual, and a tendency toward selfishness and self-indulgence in luxuries not available to the command in general, are inevitably resented by all ranks.
1. Cooperate in spirit as well as in fact. Cooperation must work in two directions. It arises from a wholehearted desire by all members to further the effective operations of the team.
1. Exercise initiative and promote the spirit of initiative in your subordinates.
1. Be conspicuously loyal to those below you as well as to those above you. Support those under you as long as the individuals concerned have been discharging their duties competently. The commander who seeks, however, to protect an incompetent subordinate from correction by a higher commander is being disloyal himself. Loyalty is a primary trait of leadership and demands unqualified support of the policies of superior officers, whether the individual concerned personally favors them or not.
1. Avoid the development of a clique of favorites. While it is difficult to avoid being partial to subordinates who have rendered loyal and superior service over a period of time, the temptation to show partiality should be vigorously resisted.
1. Be morally courageous. The commander who fails to stand by his principles where the welfare of his command is concerned, or who attempts to avoid the responsibility for mistakes of his com
mand, will fail to gain or hold the respect of his associates or subordinates.
1. Share danger and hardship. A leader who has elements of his command subject to danger or to hardship of any kind should visit them as often as possible to demonstrate without ostentation his willingness to assume his share of the difficulties.

#### Principle VI - Insure That the Task Is Understood, Supervised, and Accomplished.
1. Through study and practice, develop the ability to think clearly and to issue clear, concise, positive orders.
1. Encourage subordinates to seek immediate clarification about any point in your orders or directives that they do not understand perfectly.
1. Question your subordinates and assistants to determine if there is any doubt or misunderstanding as to the task to be performed.

1. Insure by inspections and training tests that your command is being trained in accordance with training programs and doctrine prescribed by higher authority.
1. Make sure that the best available facilities for team training are provided and that maximum use is made of such devices as communications drills, battle drills, and realistic field exercises.
1. Insure that all training is purposeful and that the reasons for training are stressed and are understood by all members of the team.
1. Insure that each element of the command is acquainted with the capabilities and limitations of all other elements, thereby developing mutual trust and understanding.
1. Insure that each subordinate leader understands the mechanics of tactical control for his own echelon of command.
1. Predicate team training on modern realistic conditions.

1. Demand the highest standard of discipline and teamwork in all training.
1. Seize opportunities to train with other units, both combat and service.


#### Principle VIII-Make Sound and Timely Decisions.
1. Develop a logical and orderly thought process by constant practice in making objective estimates of the situation. Making an estimate is not restricted to the military. It is employed in the everyday life of all persons.
1. Insofar as time and occasion permit, plan for every contingency that can reasonably be foreseen.
1. Consider the advice and suggestions of your subordinates before making your own decisions.
1. Announce decisions in time to allow subordinates to make necessary plans.

#### Principle IX-Seek Responsibility and Develop a Sense of Responsibility Among Subordinates.

1. Seek diversified assignments which will give you responsibility and command experience.
1. Take advantage of any opportunity which offers increased responsibility.
1. Perform every task, large or small, to the best of your ability. Your reward will consist of increased opportunity to demonstrate your fitness to perform bigger and more important tasks.

1. Provide all possible personnel with frequent opportunities to perform duties of the next higher echelon.
1. Be quick to recognize accomplishments of your subordinates when they demonstrate initiative and resourcefulness.
1. Correct errors in the use of judgment and initiative in such a way as to encourage the individual. Avoid public criticism or condemnation. Be liberal, however, in openly giving praise which is deserved.
1. Give unstintingly of help and advice when such are requested by those under your command.

1. Accept justified criticism.
1. Adhere to what you think is right; have the courage of your convictions.

### ADDITIONAL LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES USEFUL TO NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS

The noncommissioned officer has certain advantages and certain disadvantages in the exercise of leadership. His constant and close association with his subordinates affords him an opportunity to impress his leadership upon them almost continuously. On the other hand, close association robs him of many advantages enjoyed by those whose station is more remote from their command. The following techniques are particularly useful to the noncommissioned officer:

#### Principle III-Know Your Men and Look out for Their Welfare

1. Cultivate an intimate knowledge of the personal and family background of your men without invading their personal privacy.
1. Be attentive to the health of your men; your close contact with them will permit you to detect evidence of ill health quite early.

Commanders of regiments and lower units have the distinct advantage of participating in the actual accomplishment of missions assigned to their units. Superior leadership of the men in platoons, companies, battalions, and regiments inessential. The soldier's opinion of all officers usually will be the result of the opinion he forms of the few officers with whom he is closely associated. The following techniques are particularly useful to officers commanding regiments and lower units:

#### Principle I - Know Your Job.

1. Avoid overspecializing in too narrow afield to the extent that you lose your perspective.

1. Protect the health of your command by taking an active interest in your medical service.

### ADDITIONAL LEADERSHIP TECHNIQUES USEFUL TO COMMANDERS OF DIVISIONS AND HIGHER UNITS

The higher commanders control the destiny of many men and the responsibility therefore is greater. The following techniques are particularly useful to commanders of divisions and higher units:

#### Principle I - Know Your Job
1. Keep informed of the relative development of all units under your control by frequent visits and command inspections. Visits and inspections by a commander and his staff are the most effective method of determining whether leadership principles are being applied correctly not only by the commander but also by subordinate leaders.
1. Study those aspects of war upon which basic policy is laid in high command.
1. Employ your staff as extensions of your personality during staff visits, and for the primary purpose of fostering friendly and efficient relationships between yourself and your subordinate commanders.

1. Make certain that disciplinary measures taken by subordinate commanders are consistent and just.

#### Principle IV-Keep Your Men Informed.
1. Make full use of orders, memorandums, conferences, talks, informational and educational material, and unit newspapers to keep your command well informed. Nevertheless, avoid the dissemination of administrative matters that are not actually necessary.
